# Sebastian Otegui's repository
Hello 🖐️!!!
This is a repository that works as a portfolio to showcase my programming abilities 💻.
In here you can find progect that involve Python with data manipulation. Some are only Python code, but there also some that use popular libraries like Pandas 🐼 and NumPy 📊 among others!!!

The projects are as follows:
-
1.- U.S. Medical Insurance Costs:
  In this project, a CSV file with medical insurance costs will be investigated using Python basic fundamentals. The goal with this project will be to analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.
  
2.- Reggie Linear Regression Skeleton:
  Simple -Linear Regresion- with Python.
  
3.- Frida Kahlo Project:
  Using Python 'lists' to regroup information.
