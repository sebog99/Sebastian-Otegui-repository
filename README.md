# Sebastian Otegui's repository
Hello 🖐️!!!
This is a repository that works as a portfolio to showcase my programming abilities 💻.
In here you can find progect that involve `Python` 🐍 with data manipulation 💾. Some are only Python code, but there also some that use popular libraries like `Pandas` 🐼 and `NumPy` 📊 among others!!!

## The projects are as follows:

1.- NBA Trends Project:
  Make insightful analysis and represent those results visually using libraries like `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` into histograms 📊, scatterplots and boxplots.

2.- EDA: Diagnosing Diabetes:
  Using `EDA` (Exploratoy Data Analysis) to inspect clean and validate data from csv files. Using the famous the libraries `Pandas` 🐼 and `NumPy` 📊.

3.- Page Funnel Visits:
  Using `Pandas` 🐼 library, `ETL` (Extract Transform, and Loading) the information from different csv filesto create useful `DataFrames`. Then analyze the information to uncover patterns and obtain actionable insights.

4.- U.S. Medical Insurance Costs:
  In this project, a CSV file with medical insurance costs will be investigated using Python basic fundamentals. The goal with this project will be to analyze various attributes within insurance.csv to learn more about the patient information in the file and gain insight into potential use cases for the dataset.

5.- Hurricane Analysis:
  Organize and manipulate data using Python lists and dictionaries to categorize the information from various hurricanes 🌪️.

6.- Reggie Linear Regression Skeleton:
  Simple `Linear Regresion` code with Python 🐍.
  
7.- Frida Kahlo Project:
  Using Python lists to regroup information.
